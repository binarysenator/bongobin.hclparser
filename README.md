The BongoBin HCL Parser has been written to help support the updating of Terraform Variable files (tfvars).
The use of Microsoft's CAF abstraction layer over Terraform relys on tfvar files being a static set of text, this command line tool is intended to help read, merge and modify files after they are joined together.
